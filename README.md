# An evaluation app for Django Girls workshops and any other event

[Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) is a worldwide volunteer driven initiative that is aiming to introduce women who have never coded before to the world of technology and increase diversity by offering free coding workshops. After every workshop the organizers use to ask the attendees to fill out an evaluation sheet with questions about the workshop, how they liked it, what to improve next time and so on.

So far, the workshop organizers in Leipzig and Dresden have printed out all questions on paper. This is not a very techie approach though :-) It would be pretty cool to have an app that could be opened by the attendees on their mobile phone after scanning a QR-Code. This app could be useful for workshop organizers of other communities too.

The following requirements would be good to have (a rough overview):

- The organizers should be able to add questions.
- The organizers should be able to choose certain types of answer options.
- The organizers can login into an admin area.
- In the admin area the organizers can create the question/answer sets.
- In the admin area the organizers can export a PDF with the results of the evaluation.
- The attendees can scan a QR-Code that will forward them to the evaluation app.
- The app should be multilingual.

Of course this is just a proposal, you could add your own ideas too! Same applies to the technology, you could learn here. If you already have an idea how to realize this, fine! Go on! We are happy to help here too.
